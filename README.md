# CPSC471-Atten-done

Atten-done is the web-app that is the solution to the common inconvenience and irritability of having to record attendance by-hand. It is a revolutionary system that makes recording/taking attendance paperless. As a teacher or as a student, this makes the process easier both ways. 
The project produces a more convenient and simplified database to store and record the attendance of the individuals involved in order to bypass the obsolete ways of marking attendance. The main product is a Web-App, supported by a mobile app to record attendance more easily.
The product features: recording attendance, being able to see and edit each student entity(allergies, contact info) based on the type of the event(playschool, uni, high school). Also, sharing details with parents/guardian about the whereabouts of their kid to help the parent/guardian stay informed as well as providing attendance records to the parents as an accountability tool for their children.
